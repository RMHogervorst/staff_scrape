This describes the basic way to scrape the staff of our university.

To be clear: Scraping is not always allowed and can be a breach of
contract of the terms of service of a website. Some people argue
that it is just another page view. I take no side here.

I use this to scrape 34 pages maximum so in a way my infraction is minor.
Judging by the spam emails I recieve on a weekly basis some of those
spammers do the same thing. anyway..

Back to the goal: I wanted to make a simple data set of my direct colleagues. You will find a scraping
instruction in the R folder.
